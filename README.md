# FDF

This project is about creating a simplified graphic "wireframe"
representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via
segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as
a parameter to the program.

Each number corresponds to a point in space:
- The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
- The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
- The value corresponds to its altitude.

## Features

- Shows map using isometric projection.
- Quits the program by pressing 'esc'.



## To Do List

- Parse the map 
- Link two points in the map with a line.
- Color line as a function of altitude (https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/colors.html).
- Transform x, y and z to isometric projection (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28607713/convert-3d-coordinates-to-2d-in-an-isometric-projection).
